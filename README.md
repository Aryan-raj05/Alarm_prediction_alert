| Column                         |   % Missing | Why the blank rows appear                             | What we’ll do                                                                                             | Why this helps the model                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------: | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `last_time_cleared`            | **40–60 %** | An alarm still open obviously has no “cleared” time.  | **Keep it blank.** Add new Boolean `is_active = 1 if NaN`.                                                | The model can learn that “open alarms” behave differently from closed ones.            |
| `alarmed_object_source_system` |  **≈ 80 %** | Legacy gear never logs the OSS ID; new gear does.     | **Drop for now.** Too sparse to be useful except maybe for anomaly work.                                  | Removes noise and shrinks feature set; no downstream code breaks if column disappears. |
| `is_service_affecting`         |  **≈ 45 %** | Field optional in the NMS GUI—many operators skip it. | **Keep.** Impute missing with literal string `"UNKNOWN"` **and** add flag `is_service_affecting_missing`. | The NULL itself can carry signal (operators tend to omit it for non-critical alarms).  |
| `life_span_(minutes)`          |   **≈ 2 %** | Active alarms don’t have a life-span yet.             | **Keep.** Fill with column median; add `life_span_missing`.                                               | Prevents the model seeing crazy 0/NaN values, but still flags “still active.”          |
| Timestamps                     |   **< 1 %** | Occasional parser glitches or clock skew.             | **Keep.** `pd.to_datetime(..., errors="coerce")`. Drop a row only if *all* three timestamps are NaT.      | Preserves 99 % of data; rows with no time context at all are useless anyway.           |
| High-cardinality categoricals  |     **0 %** | Fully populated.                                      | **Keep.** Encode via one-hot (tree models) or target-encoding / hashing (LR, NN).                         | Retains the core descriptive power of the dataset.                                     |
| `additional_text`              |  **≈ 95 %** | Engineers rarely fill notes.                          | **Drop** for baseline; you can revisit with NLP if time allows.                                           | Saves you from huge sparse TF-IDF vectors that add little lift in a weekend hackathon. |
